### What this does

This project takes your simple .md file and converts it into an HTML page with CSS if you are so inclined to add that.

It is split into two big parts one is the inline logic that breaks up the passed in Markdown in small sentence sized chunks and converts them to the adjuctant HTML syntax.

The block logic takes in chunks of paragraphs and splits them into the inline sentences to be better translated.
